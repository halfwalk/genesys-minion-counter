## Genesys Minion Counter

(starwarsffg 1.6, foundry 0.8.8)

Displays a configurable numeric counter for each minion group token in the scene. The visibility toggle and text settings (render style, text color/size/alpha) are client-side, so each user has control over whether or not they see the counter, and how the numbers look.

It adds a toggle button to the Tokens toolbar.

You can also choose to have the icon render above the token, or in the corner.
