## Minion Counter for Genesys & Star Wars

This is my first module. It is currently for the **starwarsffg** system 1.6 (on Foundry 0.8.8). 

I am a novice coder so there might be problems. I'm sure it could also be optimized. It is here for testing purposes, and as a learning experience for me. I haven't encountered any show-stopping bugs, but I'm not sure it's ready for actual release/use just yet.

Minion groups now have status icons that automatically update based on the number of remaining (alive) minions in the group. Works with linked and unlinked tokens.

Known issue: status icons sometimes don't persist on scene change or window refresh.

(icons made by me as well)
